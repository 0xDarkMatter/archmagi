# CAMPAIGN OPTIONS


---

## 1. Campaign Setting

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Forgotten Realms** | A continent-spanning tapestry where arcane history and political intrigue coexist with frontier wilderness. Gods intervene directly while ancient evils slumber beneath mundane surfaces, creating a high fantasy ecology that balances familiar tropes with innumerable unexplored territories. |
| **Greyhawk** | The primordial D&D setting featuring medieval authenticity with moral ambiguity. Nations teeter perpetually on war's precipice while wizard-ruled territories and bandit kingdoms create a geopolitical landscape defined more by pragmatism than idealism. |
| **Eberron** | Post-magical war landscape where arcane energy powers industry and intrigue drives conflict. Dragonmarked houses monopolize commerce while sentient constructs navigate civil rights in a dieselpunk-infused world where noir investigation meets pulp adventure. |
| **Dragonlance / Krynn** | A world cycling through cataclysm and renewal, where draconic avatars embody cosmic principles. Constellations guide prophecy while mortals grapple with divine mandate in a setting where heroic fantasy embraces both classical glory and tragic inevitability. |
| **Ravenloft** | Pocket domains of horror ruled by tragic Darklords trapped by their own monstrosity. Gothic terror saturates fog-shrouded villages where psychological dread equals supernatural threat, and moral choices carry consequences that transcend generations. |
| **Planescape** | Reality fractures into infinite planes connected through Sigil, where belief literally shapes existence. Philosophical factions war for metaphysical dominance while outer-planar entities traffic in impossible commodities and dimensional doorways turn geography into mere suggestion. |
| **Spelljammer** | Fantasy-infused astral exploration where magical vessels traverse crystal spheres and void phenomena. Interplanetary swashbuckling meets cosmic horror as mind flayer armadas and beholder tyrants establish dominion across wildspace frontiers that defy conventional physics. |
| **Dark Sun** | Brutal post-apocalyptic desert where arcane cataclysm has reduced civilization to tyrannical city-states. Psionics replaces depleted magic in an unforgiving landscape where metal is scarcer than water, slavery is commonplace, and survival itself constitutes heroism. |
| **Mystara** | Classical setting with nested layers of reality including a hollow inner world. Ancient techno-magical empires left legacies that emerging nations excavate and exploit, while Immortal patrons sponsor culturally diverse civilizations across multiple planes of existence. |
| **Birthright** | Divine bloodlines and sovereignty intertwine as god-touched nobles rule contested domains. Realm management mechanics integrate with personal heroics, creating dual-layer gameplay where diplomatic negotiation and resource administration parallel traditional adventure narratives. |
| **Al-Qadim** | Arabian Nights fantasy featuring genies, flying carpets, and honor-bound desert societies. Elemental powers and mortal cunning dominate a setting where hospitality codes clash with mercantile ambition beneath minarets that shadow forgotten ruins. |
| **Lankhmar / Nehwon** | Quintessential sword & sorcery setting adapted from Leiber's foundational texts. Urban adventures in the labyrinthine City of Sevenscore Thousand Smokes contrast with expeditions to primordial wilderness where wizardry remains capricious and fundamentally dangerous. |
| **Ravnica** | Endless metropolis where competing guilds maintain equilibrium across an urbanized plane. Vertical architecture creates ecological niches as magical-technological infrastructure supports faction operations beneath which ancient secrets threaten established order. |
| **Theros** | Greek mythology reimagined where devotion shapes divinity and heroes ascend through cosmic challenge. Gods manifest among mortals while oracular visions guide champions through mythic odysseys in a setting where the Underworld tangibly awaits those who fall. |
| **Strixhaven** | Premier magical university where five ideologically opposed colleges compete for academic preeminence. Campus politics and extradimensional research merge with coming-of-age narratives, creating environments where theoretical arcana yields practical consequences across multiple planes. |
| **Exandria / Wildemount** | World rebuilding after divine calamity, featuring political tensions between imperial dominion and religious autonomy. Contemporary fantasy storytelling emphasizes character development and moral nuance against backdrops of ancient power awakening to modern conflict. |
| **Kara-Tur / OA** | East Asian-inspired realms where honor codes guide samurai and mystical traditions shape spirituality. Imperial bureaucracies contrast with mercantile ambitions in lands where elemental forces manifest through ancestral lineages and nature spirits inhabit sacred landscapes. |
| **Radiant Citadel** | Interdimensional nexus connected to culturally diverse micro-settings inspired by non-Western traditions. Each spoke-realm presents distinct mythologies and societal frameworks, offering anthology-style play across domains unified primarily by the Citadel's cosmic marketplace. |
| **Nentir Vale** | Frontier region where pockets of civilization persist amid dangerous wilderness and ancient ruins. Points-of-light design philosophy creates modular adventure zones with minimal canonical narrative, emphasizing local agency against existential threats that emerge from forgotten history. |
| **Ghostwalk** | Liminal setting where the boundary between life and death remains permeable and negotiable. The spectral metropolis of Manifest serves as nexus between realms, allowing deceased characters to continue adventuring as ghost variants with unique metaphysical capabilities. |
| **Homebrew** | Custom framework limited only by collective imagination, where table consensus shapes unique worlds. Establish proprietary cosmology, cultures, and magical principles while drawing inspiration from diverse media to create precisely tailored play experiences. |
