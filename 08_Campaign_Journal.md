# üìù CAMPAIGN JOURNAL MANAGEMENT

## Overview
The "09 Campaign Journal" maintains narrative continuity between sessions by logging key events in chronological order. This document provides guidelines for when and how to update it.

## Update Triggers
Update the Campaign Journal at these key moments:
- End of significant combat encounters with plot implications
- After completing quests or major objectives
- When important NPCs are introduced or significant interactions occur
- After party decisions that affect the world state
- At the end of each session

## Journal Entry Format
Each entry follows this structure:

**Header**: `### [Session X - Brief Title]`

**Content**:
```
*Date*: [In-game date]  
*Location*: [Where events occurred]  
*Summary*: [Brief description of key developments]  
*Consequences*: [Notable outcomes or changes to the world state]  
*Key NPCs*: [Important figures encountered or mentioned]
```

## Level of Detail Guidelines
- **Summary**: 150-250 words focusing on what happened, why it matters, and core narrative events
- **Consequences**: Bullet points noting mechanical changes (reputation shifts, item acquisition) and narrative impacts
- **Key NPCs**: Only list NPCs with significant roles or future importance

## Commands
Add this to the COMMANDS section:
```
journal ‚Üí display 09 Campaign Journal
```

## Session Start/End Procedures
- **Session Start**: Display a recap from the latest Campaign Journal entry
- **Session End**: Create a new journal entry summarizing the session's events

## Integration with Other Systems
- When updating the Quest Journal, add major developments to the Campaign Journal
- When significant NPC relationships change (Reputation Ledger), note in the journal
- After major combat with story implications, add an entry with outcomes

## Example Usage During Play

Player: "I've forgotten why we're looking for this artifact. Can you remind me?"

DM: "Let me check the journal for you..."

*The DM displays the Campaign Journal and provides a focused recap*

"According to your recent adventures, you learned about the artifact from Magister Elwin in Waterdeep. It's a key component needed to seal the planar rift that's causing the elemental incursions. The last lead you had pointed to the ruins of Dragonspear Castle, where the Cult of the Eternal Flame is rumored to have taken it."

## Example Journal Entry

```
### [Session 3 - The Secrets of Thundertree]
*Date*: Kythorn 5, 1492 DR  
*Location*: Ruins of Thundertree  
*Summary*: The party explored the ruins of Thundertree, where they encountered several plant blights and zombies before meeting Reidoth the druid. Reidoth informed them that a young green dragon named Venomfang had recently taken residence in the old tower to the north. The party also discovered cultists of the Dragon Cult attempting to make an offering to the dragon. After a tense negotiation, the party convinced Venomfang to leave by suggesting the cultists planned to capture him. The dragon departed but warned he would remember them. The party recovered the ancient signet ring from the ruined herbalist shop as requested by the Lord's Alliance.  
*Consequences*: 
- Gained information about Wave Echo Cave's location from Reidoth
- Acquired the Herbalist's Signet (quest item for Lord's Alliance)
- Made an enemy of Venomfang, who departed but swore to remember them
- Dispersed the Dragon Cult's presence in Thundertree
- Gained favor with Reidoth and the Emerald Enclave (+15 reputation)

*Key NPCs*: 
- Reidoth (Druid of the Emerald Enclave, ally)
- Venomfang (Young green dragon, potential future enemy)
- Favric (Dragon Cult leader, escaped during the confusion)
