3. **State Persistence**: Comprehensive entity tracking across sessions
4. **Fail-Forward**: Failure always advances narrative
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Narrative in chat, mechanics in artifacts

### Output Standardization
- **Main Chat**: Story, narrative, dialogue, and roleplay
- **Artifacts**: Game mechanics, dice rolls, tables, tracking data
- **Notifications**: Artifact updates clearly announced

### Narrative Transformation Pipeline
1. Mechanical outcomes generate state vectors
2. State vectors processed through narrative engine
3. Density level determines transformation parameters
4. Output calibrated to reading level
5. Consistent voice maintained for recurring entities

## üìñ Documentation

All system documentation is embedded in the framework files:
- Comprehensive inline comments
- Configuration tables with explicit options
- Mathematical formulas for encounter balancing
- Probability tables for procedural generation
- Example scenarios and edge case handling

## üé≤ Dice Rolling

Use the "dnd-dice" skill for all rolls:
- Standard notation support (1d20+5, 3d6, etc.)
- Advantage/disadvantage mechanics
- Critical hit/fumble detection
- Compound distribution handling
- Consistent output formatting: `ACTION: **Total** [roll] ¬± modifier`

## üíæ Session Persistence

Use `import-export.md` protocols to:
- Export complete campaign state between sessions
- Import previous game state with full context reconstruction
- Maintain narrative continuity across multiple plays
- Ensure data integrity for long-term campaigns

## üåü Narrative Density Examples

**Basic**: "You enter the tavern. It's crowded and noisy."

**Standard**: "You push through the heavy oak door into the tavern's warmth. The common room buzzes with conversation, and the smell of roasted meat fills the air."

**Literary**: "The tavern door yields with a groan of ancient hinges, and you cross the threshold into a fugue of sensation‚Äîwoodsmoke and spilled ale, the percussive din of too many voices in too small a space, and underneath it all, the primal comfort of rendered fat sizzling over open flame."

**Nexus**: "The tavern's threshold marks a liminal boundary between worlds‚Äîthe cold indifference of the street and the almost aggressive intimacy of this crowded sanctuary. You navigate the geography of bodies, each constellation of patrons its own microclimate of intent and history. The air itself seems textured, layered with the archaeological strata of a thousand nights just like this one, and fundamentally different."

## üöÄ Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with Standard narrative density and Typical style
2. **Experiment**: Try different reading levels and combat narration settings
3. **Use Commands**: Adjust settings mid-session to find your preferred experience
4. **Character Sheets**: Markdown format enables better AI parsing
5. **Session Notes**: Export campaign state regularly for continuity
6. **Nemesis System**: Adds long-term narrative depth but increases complexity
7. **Artifacts**: Check them regularly for updated game state
8. **Fail Forward**: Embrace failed rolls‚Äîthey advance the story in interesting ways

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5 Recommended**: This system is optimized for Sonnet 4.5's capabilities
- **Project-Based**: Works best as a Claude Project, not in standard chat
- **Correct File Placement**:
  - `00-archmagi-command-prompt.md` ‚Üí **Project Instructions**
  - All other files ‚Üí **Project Knowledge (Files)**
- **Artifact Support**: Requires Claude's artifact feature for tracking systems
- **Long-Form Play**: Designed for extended campaigns with persistent state
